                    Tribe of Ifugao
                    The famed rice terraces were erected almost 2,000 years ago by the Ifugao Tribe of Baguio City. 
                    Ifugao descendants use colorful woven fabrics and headdresses in traditional garb.
                    Metalworking in iron and brass, weaving, and animal sacrifice are cultural characteristics
                    shared by all Igorot peoples. They believe in spirits, especially ancestors, and have elaborate
                    ceremonies to appease them.

                    Every fourth week of February, the Panagbenga Flower Festival is held as a thanksgiving ceremony
                    for Mother Nature. Local tribes dance in native clothes as colorful floats parade along the streets.
                    The Microtel Inn is a great place to see the parades from. The festivals, events, and attractions 
                    all represent the culture of Baguio in some manner. The residents enjoy a reasonably good level of 
                    living and are quite well-off, as well as being welcoming to tourists.

                    Gongs, which come in a variety of sizes and metal components, are usually banged by males to give
                    rhythm and melody for the dances. Every province in the Northern Philippines' upland area has its
                    own pace, rhythm, or musical interpretation. The pounding is also determined by the reason for which
                    the gongs are brought out and played. The sound of gongs during a feast also represents nobility and 
                    thankfulness for major events such as weddings, family reunions, healing of the sick, or even 
                    the closing rituals of a burial or acknowledgement of an important person in the village.
                    Metalworking in iron and brass, weaving, and animal sacrifice are cultural characteristics 
                    shared by all Igorot peoples. They believe in spirits, especially ancestors, and have elaborate 
                    ceremonies to appease them. The Gong would be passed from one province to the next, completing a circle around the region.
                    It would culminate in its return to the host province on the Cordillera's 150th anniversary.
