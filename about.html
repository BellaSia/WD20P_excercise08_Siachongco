                        <p>
                            The Ibalois and the Kankanaeys were the main groups that first settle in the areas surrounding Baguio. 
                            Spanish colonizers constructed a zeus, or military outpost, in the neighboring town of La Trinidad, Benguet, 
                            but Baguio City, then known as Kafagway, received little attention.
                            Baguio became recognized when the Americans gained control of the Philippines. To avoid the summer heat, many of these 
                            American soldiers—from generals to the lowest clerk—would spend their summer vacation in Baguio. The location was subsequently 
                            designated as the Philippines' Summer Capital. The Kennon Route, the first road directly linking Baguio with the lowlands of Pangasinan, 
                            was constructed in 1903 with the help of Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese laborers. </p>
                        
                        <p> The second city after Manila to get a charter was Baguio, which did so on September 1, 1909. 
                            They expanded Baguio's development by erecting parks and public buildings including Governor 
                            Pack Road and Session Road in honor of the governor general Luke E. Wright, Daniel Burnham Park 
                            in honor of the city architect Daniel Burnham, and Wright Park in honor of the governor general.

                        <p> Baguio City is tucked away in northern Luzon's Cordillera Central mountain range, some 1,600 meters above sea level. 
                            The province of Benguet encloses the city. When Daniel Burnham drew the city's layout, 
                            he used City Hall as a point of reference. From east to west, the city's boundaries run 8.2 kilometers (5.1 mi) and north to south, 
                            respectively. In terms of height, it is the tallest city in the Philippines.
                        </p>
                       
                         <p> 
                            Baguio City is located 5,000 feet above sea level and has a total land area of 57.49 square kilometers. 
                            Its 16°C average temperature is nearly 10°C colder than the majority of lowland areas in the Philippines.
                            Approximately 350,000 residents of various ethnic, linguistic, and religious origins call the city home today. 
                            Session, Magsaysay, Abanao, and Harrison roads, which are the main thoroughfares, are lined by dense commercial sectors 
                            that make up the core business center.

                            Among the goods for which Baguio City is renowned are vegetables. This is due to the fact 
                            that the warm temperature of the city readily supports a wide variety of plants and fresh vegetables, 
                            including cabbages. In addition to these, the city is also home to a variety of other flowers, 
                            including roses, sunflowers, hydrangeas, bromeliads, marigolds, impatiens, Christmas cactus, and poinsettias.
                            Foods like peanut brittle, choco flakes, lengua, strawberry, and ube jams are 
                            very popular among visitors. These goods may be purchased for as little as 50 to 200 pesos.

                            The city was first inhabited by the Ibaloi people. However, more residents flocked to Baguio City 
                            as development and renovation began in the early 1900s. Igorot tribes and lowland Ilokanos began to 
                            occupy the area in addition to the Americans (Merikano) and mestizos. When the Kennon Road was being built,
                             Japanese and Chinese workmen who were the heads of their families made the decision to settle in the city.
                             As a result, Baguio City is a blending pot of cultures and ethnicities. 345,366 people called the city home as of 2015, 
                             living in 87,731 homes at a density of 4.6 people per family. Furthermore, 
                             Baguio City has a demographic that is quite youthful, with 65.5% of the population being under 30. 
                             about 51.3% of persons

                            Mining operations began in the 1930s, the same year that Kennon Road was opened to vehicular traffic. 
                            This is consistent with the local government's plan to transform City of Pines into a hub for folk arts and crafts.
                            Its distinctive dining culture is also a part of the economic environment. Session Road, Teacher's Camp, Bonifacio Street, 
                            Mines View Park, and Baguio Fastfood Center, which is the closest to the public market, are just a 
                            few of the numerous shopping and dining options in Baguio.
                            The infrastructure of Baguio City, a target for investments, may support certain commercial operations, particularly 
                            inside the BCEZ or the Baguio

                            Roads in Baguio are well-established. The North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) from Bulacan to Tarlac and the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEX) 
                            from Tarlac to La Union provide access to the Summer Capital of the Philippines.
<br> <br>
                            Kennon Road, Aspiras-Palispis Highway (also known as Marcos Highway), and Naguilian Road are the three primary 
                            routes that leadto Baguio (or Quirino Highway). Asin Road connects Baguio with the lowlands. 
                            Benguet's Tuba, where all routes pass through. Due to its zigzagging road, Kennon Road is regarded as the most perilous but also the most beautiful path 
                            because of the lion's head and it is less twisting road, the Marcos Highway is the broadest and safest route. 
                            The longest of the three is Quirino Highway, which is often used by those coming from the north.
